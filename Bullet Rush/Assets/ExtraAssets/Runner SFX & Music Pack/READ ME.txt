Thank you for purchasing the Beauty Sound Pack. This pack is created by MadRooster Game Audio Lab team. The pack includes many loop sounds and music tracks that can be used in any commercial or non-commercial game. 

We produce sounds and music for all kinds of games from Hyper-Casual to MOBA, FPS to Puzzle; and we created this pack with our years of experience in the game industry.

All assets are listed in .wav format and we recommend the developers to compress them into suitable formats such as .ogg vorbis, mp3 etc. in their game engines.

Here are the genres that the developers tend to use our sound pack; Runner, Stack Runner, Transform Runner, Hypnotic Runner, Endless Runner, Hyper-casual, Casual.

The package includes;
2 x Loopable Music Tracks (x3 variations for each)
4 x Stingers
133 x Sound Effects
